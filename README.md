# Ngrx Walkthrough

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

## Let's cover what you did:

  - Defined actions to express events.
  - Defined two reducer functions to manage different parts of the state.
  - Registered the global state container that is available throughout your application.
  - Defined the state, as well as selectors that retrieve specific parts of the state.
  - Created two distinct components, as well as a service that fetches from the Google Books API.
  - Injected the Store and Google Books API services to dispatch actions and select the current state.
 

This code is from [NgRx Site](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/walkthrough)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
